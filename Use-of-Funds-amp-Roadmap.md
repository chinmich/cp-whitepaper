# Use of Funds & Roadmap

BlockMason has developed a specific, concrete plan for the use and allocation of revenue from the ICO. Depending on the total amount of CPT purchased, we will execute our development plan in the manner described below. Our support and maintenance plan includes not only important documentation and customer support, but also porting of FiD to other operating systems and UCAC development for customers use in various implementations of the CP.  We will continue to update and advance FiD as an open source example of how to implement the CP. We would like to reiterate that BlockMason has already released a working beta version of CP & FiD, which we invite everyone to test while considering their participation in our ICO.
