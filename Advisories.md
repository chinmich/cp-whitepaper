# Advisories

Purchasers of BlockMason’s CP product-use tokens receive a perpetual, fully-paid-up license to use a portion of CP network capacity, proportionate to the number of tokens purchased, pursuant to an industry-standard licensing agreement.  Title and ownership of Foundation, CP, FiD and all related documentation and support structure resides in BlockMason.  BlockMason reserves the right to adjust the amount of network capacity, and the number of transactions allocated to each CP token, using reasonable efforts to maintain efficient CP network operation and avoid over-capacity.  Our ICO of product-use tokens is not a solicitation of investments.  Purchases of our ICO product-use tokens should be based on each purchaser’s evaluation of our products and each purchaser’s intended use and development of those products.  Our products are offered "AS IS" - purchasers make their own judgments based on the beta versions and documentation for the products.  We make no warranties, and we expressly disclaim all warranties, express or implied, including the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and noninfringement. We cannot guarantee against service interruptions or make warranties about the Ethereum network.  Purchasers are responsible for consulting their own country’s laws and regulations.

Our legal counsel has issued an opinion letter concluding that U.S. securities law presents no reason to prevent persons in the United States from participating in our ICO.  [link]
