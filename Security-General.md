# Security (General)

Writing code for Ethereum is a new and complex endeavor. Because of its novelty, and the general difficulty of keeping untested code 100% secure, the Ethereum community has recently witnessed multiple large scale hacks. BlockMason is fully committed to avoiding the mistakes of these compromised endeavors, and we have taken the following steps to keep our application and ICO secure:

* Write secure code according to best practices.

* Slowly rollout all new features and improvements, first locally, before proceeding to the testnet, and finally to the mainnet.

* Professionally audit any code interacting with Ethereum or CP tokens.

* Offer a ‘bug bounty’ to encourage whitehat hackers to identify and eradicate coding errors.

* Employ ENS addresses, make available ICO contracts prior to the ICO, and establish clear and secure communication channels.

These steps comprise only the beginnings of our final security plan. BlockMason is committed to constantly researching and evaluating threats faced by other dapp companies, and to adjust our security measures accordingly. We have invested a tremendous amount of time, energy (and *love*) into CP and FiD, and we would be personally devastated at the emergence of any serious security issue. Our reputation, and your trust, is on the line—therefore, we approach issues of security with the maximum level of consideration and caution.
