# Initial Coin Offering

The Credit Protocol ICO will begin no later than four weeks from the date of this whitepaper and last for 30 days. BlockMason will make available 175 million CP Tokens (CPT) of the 250 million for sale at 0.01 ETH for 2.5 CPT, with up to a 50% additional bonus based on timing of purchase.  The total supply of CP tokens is fixed, and no more tokens will be created. Any uncommitted tokens will be held in reserve for future offerings.

## Pre-ICO Period (50% Token Bonus)

BlockMason is fully aware of issues present in many ICOs, in which smaller purchasers fail to receive an opportunity to purchase tokens during the ICO. Therefore, BlockMason offers to guarantee allocation of tokens to early adopters of CP, regardless of size, who purchase tokens during the pre-ICO period. This window serves as an opportunity for all potential customers to reserve token purchase slots, unlike other ICOs where "whales" and scalpers monopolize large blocks of allocation, squeezing out smaller purchases, and profiting from flipping tokens following the ICO. Using a whitelist, BlockMason will record the Ethereum addresses of all users who request a guaranteed slot. Each address that requested allocation is guaranteed a chance to purchase CPT during the early 2 day period (and receive a 50% token bonus) in a process executed via the smart contract governing the ICO. Customers do not *need *to sign up for the whitelist to purchase CPT during the pre-ICO; it merely ensures an opportunity to purchase tokens. Outside of the hardcap, there is no cap to how much a customer can purchase during the pre-ICO period.

## ICO Bonus Tiers

At the start of the normal ICO period, all purchases made during the pre-ICO period will immediately count towards the ICO bonus pool count (see the chart below), and proceed chronologically in the order which they were received. Purchases made during the ICO will receive bonuses based on the sequence in which they were made, and continue sequentially behind all pre-ICO customers. For example, if there are 18,000,000 CPT token purchases during the pre-ICO period, the first purchaser during the normal ICO period would receive a 25% purchase bonus. In this case, the pre-ICO purchases would exceed the capacity of the initial purchase bonus pools prior to the opening of the ICO, for the purpose of calculating bonuses.

## Developers’ Token Pool

A Developers’ Token Pool equal to 20% of the total token supply will be set aside for the BlockMason team.

## Friend in Debt

10% of CP Tokens will be set aside and used to support the transactions of Friend in Debt and any other demo dapps that BlockMason develops with the CP.
