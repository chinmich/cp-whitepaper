# Conclusion

Unlike the products of many ICOs, the Credit Protocol offers more than a promise — it is a functional protocol that provides immediate value, while offering a concrete path to widespread user adoption and significant benefits for token purchasers. It has an obvious market and clear use cases, with little to no barrier to entry for potential developers and their user base. It fills a glaring hole in the Ethereum ecosystem and provides a platform for future developers to implement their own revolutionary ideas. The Credit Protocol is simultaneously bold and secure, audacious and deliberate, and, most importantly, it *works right now*.

Even more exciting, the Credit Protocol and Friend In Debt represent an objective step forward toward our vision of a world run on Ethereum. Debt is a vital factor in the growth of any economy, and without moving debt to the blockchain, the cryptocurrency ecosystem has no choice but to stagnate. The Credit Protocol enables the next phase of Ethereum’s development, one in which the creation of large-scale projects and infrastructure becomes inseparable from the blockchain.

Implementations of the CP can democratize currency creation by recording mediums of exchange, units of account, store of value, and standards of deferred payment. In fact, because an individual need not own ether in order to draw debt in ether, it is entirely possible to imagine a future in which debts and credits recorded on the Credit Protocol could exceed the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies combined - dramatically increasing the scale of the digital economy.

Similarly, Friend in Debt is an application built for the present and designed for the future. It promises a global network of decentralized transactions that empower individuals left behind by the bureaucratic, profiteering mess of large institutions like banks and Paypal. It trusts in the ability of the individual and the force of the multitude, empowering single actors to seize their financial destinies while encouraging economic development in communities ranging from families in Minnesota to villages in Mauritania.

We at BlockMason believe in the future of Ethereum, but Ethereum’s future needs the Credit Protocol—a platform that will draw in users across the globe previously uninitiated in Ethereum, and realize the potential of Ethereum not just to support a popular cryptocurrency, but to engender an entire ecosystem of apps. And when Ethereum wins, we all win.
